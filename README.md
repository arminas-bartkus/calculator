Final Project of the Odin Project - Foundations

We've made it, the final project of the foundations
course at the Odin project. This one aims to test
everything I know in a deceivingly complex calculator
web page.

Requirements:

- Create functions for basic Mathematical operations 
including adding, subtracting, multiplying, and 
dividing.
- Create the UI with buttons and a display: Including 
all the numbers, equals sign, clear, decimal point (extra
credit)
- The calculator should take a value, an operator
and another value and display it on screen once equals
is pressed

Care should be taken in:

- Not allowing the user to add multiple of the
 same operator side by side.
- Not allowing the user to add multiple decimal
points in the same number
- The display should not overflow off screen
- Making sure pressing equals before necessary
does not break anything
- Adequately dealing with divisions by 0

Extra credit

- Add ability to add decimals
- Add a backspace (alongside a clear all)
- Add Keyboard support
